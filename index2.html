       The United States Army's main role is to attack and defend this nation, as well as perform land-based military operation.
     </p>
     <p>
       n June 16, 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill requiring the Army to buy new, different uniforms for the War in Afghanistan, with camouflage pattern that would better suit the Afghan environment. From 2010 onward, U.S. Army units deployed in Afghanistan were issued uniforms with MultiCam pattern. In 2015, the U.S. Army announced it will fully adopt the Scorpion W2 camouflage pattern (which is very similar to MultiCam) as the main camouflage for its units. UCP will be completely phased out with U.S. Army units by 2019. Units such as the 75th Ranger Regiment who had already widely adapted MultiCam by then, will continue to use the pattern into the foreseeable future due to its similarity to Scorpion W2. (Wikimedia)

              First unveiled and designed in 2002, MultiCam was designed for the use of the U.S. Army in varied environments, seasons, elevations, and light conditions. It is a seven-color, multi-environment camouflage pattern developed by Crye Precision[5] in conjunction with United States Army Soldier Systems Center. (Wikimedia)

          <p>
The class "A" ASU includes the army blue coat and trousers/skirt/slacks, a short or long sleeved white shirt and four-in-hand necktie (male)/neck tab (female) (for accessories and other items authorized for wear on the class "A" ASU, see ASU accessory items authorized for wear). (Wikimedia)

<h3><b>Components:</b>
The ASU consists of the following items:
<li>Coat, army blue shade 450</li>
<li>Trousers, army blue shade 451, low Waist With Belt Loops (male soldiers)</li>
<li>Slacks, Low Waist (female soldiers)</li>
<li>Skirt (female soldiers)</li>

   <h3>
     <p>
   The class "B" ASU includes the army blue trousers/skirt/slacks, a short or long sleeve white shirt. Soldiers will wear the four-in-hand necktie with the long sleeve white shirt when it is worn without the class "A" coat. Until the new ASU items are available, soldiers who have the low waist trousers with belt loops, or slacks, have the option of wearing a commercial short sleeve white shirt with shoulder loops in the open collar configuration or with a four-in-hand necktie (black neck tab for female soldiers). Soldiers have the option of wearing a commercial long sleeve white shirt with shoulder loops and a four-in-hand necktie (black neck tab for female soldiers). Soldiers who have the current commercial white shirt without shoulder loops must wear as appropriate, the black wind breaker, black pullover or black cardigan sweaters with this uniform. (Wikimedia)
   </p>
   <p>
   Soldiers who have the high waist blue trousers worn with suspenders (designed to wear with the blue mess uniform) may wear these trousers with the current ASU during this transition period. These high waist trousers must be worn with the service coat, black wind breaker, black pullover or black cardigan sweaters.(Wikimedia)

       <h4><p>
         The U.S. Air Force provides air support for land and naval forces[16][17] and aids in the recovery of troops in the field. As of 2017, the service operates more than 5,369 military aircraft, 406 ICBMs and 170 military satellites. It has a $161 billion budget and is the second largest service branch, with 318,415 active duty personnel, 140,169 civilian employees, 69,200 Air Force Reserve personnel, and 105,700 Air National Guard personnel.

  <h4><p>
    The current U.S. Air Force Service Dress Uniform, which was initially adopted in 1994 and made mandatory on 1 October 1999, consists of a three-button coat, similar to that of a men's "sport jacket" (with silver mirror-finish "U.S." pins on the lapels), matching trousers, and either a service cap or flight cap, all in Shade 1620, also known as "Air Force Blue." This is worn with a light blue shirt (Shade 1550) and a herringbone patterned necktie (Shade 1620). Metal buttons on the dress uniform were also changed at this time, transitioning satin finish buttons that employed the contemporary U.S. Air Force seal to a historically significant retro insignia that had been used by the U.S. Army Air Forces as a shoulder patch during World War II. This change was also applied to buttons on service hats retaining the chin strap and to buttons on mess dress uniforms, to include mess dress shoulder board insignia for officers. (Wikimedia)

         <h4><p>
           For work duty today, USAF ground personnel and flight personnel not engaged in flight operations wear the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU). The ABU replaces the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU), the latter having been discontinued after 31 October 2011.The ABU is also authorized as an optional item for flight crew and missile personnel when not directly engaged in flight crew or missile launch duties that would typically require a Nomex flight suit. Flight suits for missile personnel replaced a previous ultramarine blue jumpsuit that was not fire retardant. (Wikimedia)

          Flight suits are commonly worn many types of pilots, such as those of jet airplanes, helicopters, and gliders. The main purpose of Air Force flight suits is to keep the individual wearing the flight suit warm. Military flight suits are also practically designed for combat, typically offering features such as fire retardant materials and several pockets. (Militaryuniformsupply.com) The flight suit is also used in keeping the wearer safe from fires and any heat on the body.

By the 1860s, the service was known as the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the term Revenue Marine gradually fell into disuse. (Wikimedia)</h4>

         <h4>he U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with eleven in service, one in the reserve fleet, and two new carriers under construction. With 322,421 personnel on active duty and 107,577 in the Navy Reserve, the Navy is the third largest of the service branches. It has 276 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft as of June 2017.(Wikipedia)</h4>

<p>
  he U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers. It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan. The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence, deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean. It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it a frequent actor in U.S. foreign and military policy.

             The U.S. Navy underwent a comprehensive review of every uniform from 2004 through 2007, intending to replace the different working uniform for all hands and the seasonal service uniforms with a single year-round service uniform for personnel E-1 through E-6. Accordingly, the Navy Service Uniform has replaced the Winter Blue Uniform and Summer White Uniform (both discussed below), which were phased out on 31 December 2010 when the rollout of the New Service Uniform was completed. Enlisted personnel now have a single Service Uniform. Navy Junior ROTC units also received this new uniform, where, unlike in the U.S. Navy proper, it is worn by both cadet officers and enlisted cadets.(Wikimedia)

All members wear uniforms while performing their duties.(Wikimedia)</h4> <h4>Nationwide, CAP is a major operator of single-engine general aviation aircraft, used in the execution of its various missions, including orientation flights for cadets and the provision of significant emergency services capabilities.
